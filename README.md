# RSI-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
Using the RSI (Relative Strength Index) in forex sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the positioning of traders, whether net long or net short, to influence your own trading decisions in the currency market. While sentiment analysis can be directly translated to forex, it is also used for stocks and other assets.
